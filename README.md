Aloha! ðŸ¤™

I'm Lizzy, a front-end developer and computer science educator based in Kona, Hawaii.

â€¢ ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Kona Swim Hub, a full-stack web application to help Hawaii-based families find local swim lessons for their kids.

â€¢ ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Redux, and React Framer Motion.

â€¢ ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any team project. I'd love to contribute to something that's too big to be a solo effort.
